#Car Maker 
#This code demonstrates how Object-Oriented programming (OOP) works
#In this case, you are building cars. The cars are the object
#The car(object) has properties (doors, color, wheel size, horsepower, etc.)
#Since each car is a different object, we use the code below to create as many cars as we want
